// InsertionSort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm.
// Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted.
// For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted.
// An element which is to be inserted in this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there.
// Hence the name, insertion sort.
// The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted  into the sorted
// sub-list (in the same array).
// This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2)
