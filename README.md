## What is this about?
Hey, eventhough I write code everyday to solve practical problems, algorithms appear to be a different game.

It's time I sharpen up my algorithm skills by taking different tests. I'm documenting them here.

## Completed Tests
 - [x] [BinaryGap](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/binary_gap/) 

## ToDo Tests
 - [ ] [QHeap](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/qheap1/problem)

## ToDo:
 - [ ] Add more test cases for BinaryGap and DecimalToBaseX functions
 - [ ] Add comments to explain logic. Right now I think if I come back to this, I would remember what I did, but don't we all always feel that way ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
