Hey, eventhough I write code everyday to solve practical problems, algorithms appear to be a different game.

It's time I sharpen up my algorithm skills by taking different tests. I'm documenting them here.

ToDo:
 - [ ] Configure CI just to run tests, and document the steps (For learning purposes only 😁)
 - [ ] Add more test cases for BinaryGap and DecimalToBaseX functions
 - [ ] Add comments to explain logic. Right now I think if I come back to this, I would remember what I did,
      
    but don't we all always feel that way ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
